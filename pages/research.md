#### <u>Exploiting Hidden Convexity for Optimal Flow Control in Queueing Networks</u>
*Optimal ﬂow control in queueing networks is a challenging problem occurring in many contexts, such as data centers, cloud computing, healthcare, revenue management, and distributed networks, etc. The traditional approach has been to adopt heuristic solutions or consider inﬁnite-horizon ﬂuid or diﬀusion approximations. Motivated by emerging techniques in Robust Optimization, we propose a framework, termed Pipeline Queues, which tracks the dynamics of a queue simultaneously in terms of its queue length and waiting time. We begin by showing that the dynamics of a traditional queueing system can be modeled using our approach. Our key contribution is the uncovering of the hidden convexity resulting from our modeling approach. This leads to tractable optimization formulations that yield approximate solutions for ﬂow control problems of obtaining performance guarantees on average and quantiles of waiting time, under arbitrary arrival and service distributions with non-zero initial conditions. Our model is ﬂexible enough to capture partial observability and uncertainty of the initial state, as well as various constraints on the control policy. We apply our approach 36 diﬀerent queue networks in a real dataset at a major hospital in India, to illustrate that our proposed policies are near optimal and perform signiﬁcantly better than present heuristics.*
