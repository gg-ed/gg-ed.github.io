#### <u>Exploiting Hidden Convexity for Optimal Flow Control in Queueing Networks</u>
*This paper builds a general optimization framework (termed P-Queues) to seek a control policy in Queueing Networks that satisfies chance constraints on waiting times and other queue-based metrics. It can handle general service time distributions, general arrival distributions, non-zero initial conditions and a very large class of networks. The model appears to perform well in 36 experiments conducted on a real data set, coming within 5% of stochastic optimal and beating common heuristics by around 10%.*

This paper is co-authored with Chaithanya BANDI from Kellogg, Northwestern. This manuscript has been submitted to *Operations Research*. It will also be presented at the upcoming conferences in 2019: MostlyOM, MSOM, APS and the INFORMS Annual Meeting.

#### <u>Risk-based Manpower Planning: A Tractable Multi-period Model</u>

*This paper addresses the strategic workforce planning question of how many employees to maintain at each staffing level, and how to progress to this optimal structure through hiring and promotion decisions. Most notably, it incorporates time-in-grade as a factor. It introduces the idea of pipeline invariance, a technique that allows the effect of subsequent time period decisions to be retraced to the initial state, hence making the multi-period problem tractable.*

This paper is co-authored with Patrick JAILLET, from MIT, and my advisor, Melvyn SIM. It is motivated by the research I was conducting when I was still leading the team of HR analytics in the Public Service Division in Singapore. This manuscript is currently in Major Revision in *Operations Research*.

#### <u>The Analytics of Bed Shortages: Coherent Metric, Prediction and Optimization</u>

*This paper addresses the capacity planning question in bed management. In particular, it proposes a metric that leads to a closed-form linear program. The metric allows planners to understand the effect of projected demographic shifts, as well as perform optimization on bed capacity. It is also able to handle tandem planning of capacity across different wards.*

This paper is co-authored with Jingui XIE, from USTC, my advisor, Melvyn SIM, and Shao-Wei LAM, a collaborator in a hospital. This manuscript has been submitted to *Operations Research*. It won the Best Student Paper at POMS-HK 2018.

## Working Papers and Projects

In this section, I describe some of the working papers that I have yet to turn into a manuscript format, as well as the projects that I have or am intending to embark on.

#### Risk-based Optimization

<b>Optimization of Fork-join Queues under the Pipeline Queues Paradigm.</b> The initial P-Queues framework introduced by Chaithanya and I in the first paper above, does not trivially extend to fork-join systems; this paper seeks to do just that. This is joint work with Chaithanya BANDI and Minglong ZHOU. It will be presented at INFORMS Annual Meeting 2019, but we are in the process of making an online manuscript available.

<b>Water Management and Dispatch from a Robust Perspective.</b> The control of water around a water network in the city needs to be optimized, in order to minimize overflow and meet uncertain demand. This project was completed during my stint at the Government Technology Agency in Singapore. It is joint work with my ex-colleagues, Chii Yeh CHIN and Kai Wei TAN, and Ashley NG from the Public Utilities Board. We are in discussion if we are allowed to put a paper on the public domain.

<b>Risk-based Model for Joint Capacity and Allocation.</b> This project aims to build a general optimization model for dynamic capacity planning and allocation within systems where demand needs to be met. It is joint work with Yun Fong LIM from the Singapore Management University, and his student Peng WANG. 

#### Other Projects

<b>Inventory Decisions for Subscription-based Fashion Rental.</b> This project is a collaboration with a firm running a subscription-based rental opertaions. This is joint work with Zhenyu HU, Qinshen TANG and Ge YANG. 

<b>Jurong Port - Workforce Planning and Scheduling.</b> This project is a collaboration with Jurong Port.
