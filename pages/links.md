#### <u>Friends, Mentors and Collaborators</u>
<a href="https://yeesian.com/">Yeesian NG</a> is my high school classmate and one of my closest confidentes. Serendipitously, we found ourselves in the same space of research many years on. He is sweeping up his PhD at MIT's Operations Research Center this year and will be joining Google this Fall. If it is even possible to describe his diverse academic interests, I would say it is in the union of machine learning and operations research.

I work very closely with <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/bandi/index.htm">Chaithanya BANDI</a> from Kellogg, Northwestern. We continue to have many streams of research building on our initial work on P-Queues.

Over the course of my PhD, I was very fortunate to come under the tutelege of <a href="http://http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/index.html">Kim Chuan TOH</a> and <a href="http://bizfaculty.nus.edu/faculty-profiles/127-melvyn">Melvyn SIM</a>. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/">Patrick JAILLET</a> had also very kindly hosted me for a semester at MIT, where we worked on interesting things.
