#### <u>Friends, Mentors and Collaborators</u>
<a href="https://yeesian.com/">Yeesian NG</a> is my high school classmate and one of my closest confidentes. Serendipitously, we found ourselves in the same space of research many years on. He is currently at Google. If it is even possible to describe his diverse academic interests, I would say it is in the union of machine learning and operations research.

Over the course of my PhD, I was very fortunate to come under the tutelege of <a href="http://http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/index.html">Kim Chuan TOH</a> and <a href="https://bizfaculty.nus.edu.sg/faculty-details/?profId=127">Melvyn SIM</a>. <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/">Patrick JAILLET</a> had also very kindly hosted me for a semester at MIT, where we worked on interesting things. I also have collaborations with <a href="https://bizfaculty.nus.edu.sg/faculty-details/?profId=648">Chaithanya BANDI</a>, arising from our initial work on P-Queues.
