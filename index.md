#### About

I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at National University of Singapore and have recently graduated with my PhD in March 2019. My research interests include Robust Optimization, Satisficing, Risk-based Optimization, and applications of OR in Public Policy. I also work very closely with <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/bandi/index.htm">Chaithanya</a> from Kellogg on some Queueing applications.

In my past life, I worked in various capacities in the Singapore Public Service, with my work largely revolving around leading teams of data scientists. A largest bulk of that time is spent with the Public Service Division, in the area of Human Resource Analytics. I continue to maintain close ties with the Government Technology Agency in Singapore.

Currently, I work very closely with Minglong, a PhD student starting his fourth year in NUS.
