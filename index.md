I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at National University of Singapore and have recently graduated with my PhD in March 2019. My research interests include Robust Optimization, Satisficing, Risk-based Optimization, and applications of OR in Public Policy.

In my past life, I worked in various capacities in the Singapore Public Service, with my work largely revolving leading teams of data scientists. I continue to maintain close ties with the Government Technology Agency in Singapore.
